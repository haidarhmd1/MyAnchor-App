  "Even if your heart races, even if you feel dizzy, your body knows exactly how to calm down on its own.",
  "You don’t need to control or fight these sensations. Just allow them to be here, and let them fade naturally.",
  "And remember, no one else can see what you’re feeling inside. To the outside world, you look just fine.",
  "Right now, you are teaching your brain something powerful: that these sensations are safe, and you don’t need to fear them.”",
