        title: "Remind yourself what it is",
        text: "When panic hits, the first instinct is often fear of the unknown—“Am I dying? Is something wrong with me?” The most powerful step is to name it: “This is a panic attack.” Reminding yourself that panic is your body’s alarm system misfiring—not a heart attack, not suffocation, not losing control—instantly lowers the sense of mystery and danger. Naming it gives you a moment of perspective and tells your brain, “I know what this is, and I’ve been here before.”",

        title: "Stay where you are",
        text: "Your brain wants you to run, escape, or grab safety. But escaping teaches the brain that the situation was indeed dangerous. If you can safely stay where you are—even just for a minute longer—you send the opposite message: “This place is safe, even if my body feels scared.” Over time, choosing to stay helps retrain your brain so the next panic wave feels less threatening. The goal isn’t to trap yourself, but to gently practice presence until the fear curve eases.",

        title: "Let the sensations happen",
        text: "The more you fight panic sensations, the stronger they feel. Instead of resisting, let your body do what it does. Notice your heart racing, your breath tightening, or your hands trembling—then say, “This is just adrenaline. It’s not harmful.” By allowing the feelings to exist without rushing to stop them, your brain learns they are uncomfortable but not dangerous. This shift from fighting to allowing is the foundation of long-term recovery.",

        text: "Think of panic like an ocean wave: it rises, swells, and then always falls. If you surf it, you make it through; if you fight the wave, you struggle. Remind yourself, “This panic will peak and pass.” Staying present through the curve teaches your nervous system that panic is temporary, not endless. You don’t need to force calm—you just need to let the wave roll through and trust that your body knows how to settle itself.",

        title: "Soften your breathing",
        text: "During panic, many people breathe quickly and shallowly, which can worsen dizziness and chest tightness. Instead of forcing deep breaths, aim for soft, steady breathing: in through your nose, out through your mouth, slowly and gently. Think of sighing rather than controlling. Breathing this way signals your body’s calming system (the parasympathetic nervous system) and can take the edge off without turning into a “rescue technique.”",

        title: "Ground yourself in the present",
        text: "Panic makes your attention spiral inward—into your heartbeat, your lungs, your fears. To break this loop, gently shift your focus outward. Use grounding: notice 5 things you see, 4 things you feel, 3 things you hear. This isn’t about distracting yourself, but about reminding your brain: “The world around me is steady and safe.” Grounding pulls you out of the storm in your body and anchors you back into the present moment.",

        title: "Drop safety habits",
        text: "It’s tempting to check your pulse, sip water, scroll your phone, or plan your exit whenever panic rises. While these feel helpful in the moment, they teach your brain that you need rescuing, which keeps panic alive. Dropping safety behaviors is hard, but each time you do, you prove to yourself that you can handle panic without crutches. This doesn’t mean stripping away all comfort at once, but gently practicing being with panic as it is—without reaching for rescue.",

        text: "Your inner voice can either fuel panic or soothe it. Instead of saying, “I can’t handle this”, try phrases like, “I’ve been through this before. My body knows how to calm down. Panic always passes.” Reassurance doesn’t make panic vanish instantly, but it shifts the tone inside your mind. Self-talk acts like a steadying hand on your shoulder—reminding you that you’re not in danger and that you have the strength to ride this wave.",

        text: "Panic attacks are powerful but time-limited. Most peak within 5–10 minutes and then fade. The fear that it will “never stop” is part of the illusion. By waiting, without fighting, you prove to yourself that panic always ends. Think of it like a thunderstorm—it feels intense, but no storm lasts forever. Each time you let panic run its course, you build new evidence that the curve always comes down, and your brain gradually stops treating panic as a threat.",
